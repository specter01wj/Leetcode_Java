			 	You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding 
				letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
				If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters 
				onto the end of the merged string.

				Return the merged string.


				Example 1:

				Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
				Output: "apbqcr"
				Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
				word1:  a   b   c
				word2:    p   q   r
				merged: a p b q c r

				Example 2:

				Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
				Output: "apbqrs"
				Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
				word1:  a   b 
				word2:    p   q   r   s
				merged: a p b q   r   s

				Example 3:

				Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
				Output: "apbqcd"
				Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
				word1:  a   b   c   d
				word2:    p   q 
				merged: a p b q c   d
