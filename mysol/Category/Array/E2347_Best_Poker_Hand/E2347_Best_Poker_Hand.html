			/*
			 	You are given an integer array ranks and a character array suits. 
        You have 5 cards where the ith card has a rank of ranks[i] and a suit of suits[i].

        The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:

        1. "Flush": Five cards of the same suit.
        2. "Three of a Kind": Three cards of the same rank.
        3. "Pair": Two cards of the same rank.
        4. "High Card": Any single card.

        Return a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards.

        Note that the return values are case-sensitive.


        Example 1:

        Input: ranks = [13,2,3,1,9], suits = ["a","a","a","a","a"]
        Output: "Flush"
        Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, 
        so we have a "Flush".

        Example 2:

        Input: ranks = [4,4,2,4,4], suits = ["d","a","a","b","c"]
        Output: "Three of a Kind"
        Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards 
        with the same rank, so we have a "Three of a Kind".
        Note that we could also make a "Pair" hand but "Three of a Kind" is a better hand.
        Also note that other cards could be used to make the "Three of a Kind" hand.

        Example 3:

        Input: ranks = [10,10,2,12,9], suits = ["a","b","c","a","d"]
        Output: "Pair"
        Explanation: The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards 
        with the same rank, so we have a "Pair".
        Note that we cannot make a "Flush" or a "Three of a Kind".
