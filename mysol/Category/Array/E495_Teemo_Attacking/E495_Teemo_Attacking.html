			/*
			Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! 
			 When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. 
			 More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during 
			 the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. 
			 If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, 
			 and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.

			You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] 
			denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.

			Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.


			Example 1:

			Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
			Output: 4
			Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
			- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
			- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
			Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.

			Example 2:

			Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
			Output: 3
			Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
			- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
			- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. 
			Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
			Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
