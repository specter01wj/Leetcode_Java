			 	You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise 
				only of lowercase English letters.

				Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.

				A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. 
				A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


				Example 1:

				Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
				Output: 3
				Explanation:
				The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
				"a", "ab", and "abc".
				Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.

				Example 2:

				Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
				Output: 2
				Explanation:
				Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
				Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be 
				counted each time.
