			 	On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. 
				Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.

				You can move according to these rules:

				. In 1 second, you can either:
					. move vertically by one unit,
					. move horizontally by one unit, or
					. move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically 
					  then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
				. You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
				. You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, 
				  but these do not count as visits.


				Example 1:

				Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
				Output: 7
				Explanation: One optimal path is 
				[1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
				Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
				Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
				Total time = 7 seconds

				Example 2:

				Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
				Output: 5
