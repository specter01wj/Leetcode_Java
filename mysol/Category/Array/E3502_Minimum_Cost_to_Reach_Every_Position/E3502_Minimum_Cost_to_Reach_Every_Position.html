			 	You are given an integer array cost of size n. You are currently

        (numbered from 0 to n).

        You wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of 
        you charges a specific amount to swap places. The cost to swap with 
        person i is given by cost[i].

        You are allowed to swap places with people as follows:

          . If they are in front of you, you must pay them cost[i] to swap with them.
          . If they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.

        Return an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum total 
        cost to reach each position i in the line.

				1. Initialize result array:

          . Fill all entries with Integer.MAX_VALUE
        2. Iterate over the cost array from left to right:
          . For each person i:
            . You pay cost[i] to reach them.
            . From person i, you can move to any person at j ≥ i for free.
            . So update all such answer[j] to min(answer[j], cost[i]).
        3. Apply early break optimization:
          . Since cost propagates forward, if answer[j] <= cost[i], we stop updating further — no better cost will be applied.
