			 	Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. 
				If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

				A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.


				Example 1:

				Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
				Output: "ada"
				Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
				Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

				Example 2:

				Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
				Output: "racecar"
				Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".

				Example 3:

				Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
				Output: ""
				Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
