            All the values leaveTimei are unique.

				1. Initialize Variables:
          . maxDuration to store the maximum task duration encountered.
          . employeeId to store the ID of the employee who worked the longest task, initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE to handle ties.
          . previousEndTime to track the end time of the previous task.
        2. Iterate Over Logs:
          . For each log, calculate the duration of the task by subtracting previousEndTime from the current leaveTime.
          . If the current duration is greater than maxDuration, update maxDuration and set employeeId to the current employee's ID.
          . If the duration is equal to maxDuration but the current employee's ID is smaller, update employeeId to the current ID.
        3. Update Previous End Time:
          . Update previousEndTime to the current task's leaveTime for the next iteration.
        4. Return:
          . Finally, return the employeeId that corresponds to the longest task duration.
