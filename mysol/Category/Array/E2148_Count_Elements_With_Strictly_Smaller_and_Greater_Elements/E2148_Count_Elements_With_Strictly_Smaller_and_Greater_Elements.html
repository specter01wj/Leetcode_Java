			 	Given an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have 
				both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
				Output: 2
				Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
				Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
				In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
				Output: 2
				Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
				Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a 
				strictly greater element appear in nums.
