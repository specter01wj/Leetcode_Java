			 	You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, 
        denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.

        Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing 
        the following test operations:

          . If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:
            . Increment the count of tested devices.
            . Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in 
              the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage 
              never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
            . Move to the next device.
          . Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.

        Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
