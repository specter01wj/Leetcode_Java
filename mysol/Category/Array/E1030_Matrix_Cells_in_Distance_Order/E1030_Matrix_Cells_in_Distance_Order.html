			/*
			 	You are given four integers row, cols, rCenter, and cCenter. 
				There is a rows x cols matrix and you are on the cell with the 
				coordinates (rCenter, cCenter).

				Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by 
				their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest distance 
				to the largest distance. You may return the answer in any order 
				that satisfies this condition.

				The distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.


				Example 1:

				Input: rows = 1, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 0
				Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
				Explanation: The distances from (0, 0) to other cells are: [0,1]

				Example 2:

				Input: rows = 2, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 1
				Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
				Explanation: The distances from (0, 1) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
				The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.

				Example 3:

				Input: rows = 2, cols = 3, rCenter = 1, cCenter = 2
				Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
				Explanation: The distances from (1, 2) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
				There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, 
				such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].

		    Since the distance is limited (generally, compared with the cell count),
