			 	You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.

        You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 
        and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. 
        In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:

          . If the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2, 
            append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.

        The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. 
        For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].

        Return the array result.

				1. Initialization:
          . The first element of nums is added to arr1.
          . The second element of nums is added to arr2.
        2. Iteration:
          . Starting from the third element, the code compares the last elements of arr1 and arr2.
          . If the last element of arr1 is greater, the current element is added to arr1.
          . Otherwise, it is added to arr2.
        3. Combining the Results:
          . After processing all elements, arr1 and arr2 are concatenated into a single array result.
        4. Output:
          . The function returns the concatenated array.
