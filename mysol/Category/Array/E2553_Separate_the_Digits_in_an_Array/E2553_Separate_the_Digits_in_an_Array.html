			 	You are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. 
        Every day, for 109 days, you perform the following procedure:

          . For each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such 
            that x % i == 1.
          . Then, place those numbers on the board.

        Return the number of distinct integers present on the board after 109 days 
        have elapsed.

        Example 1:

        Input: n = 5
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board. 
        The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. 
        After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. 
        At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

        Example 2:

        Input: n = 3
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 
        Since 3 % 2 == 1, 2 will be added to the board. 
        After a billion days, the only two distinct numbers on the board are 2 and 3.

			/*sol:
				1. The problem can be solved by recognizing that after performing the procedure, 
          all numbers from 2 to n will eventually appear on the board.
        2. If n == 1, the only number on the board is 1, so the result is 1.
        3. For any n > 1, all numbers from 2 to n will eventually be added to the board, 
          so the distinct numbers on the board will be n - 1.
