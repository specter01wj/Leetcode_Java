			 	Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is 
        an acronym of words.

        The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed 
        by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. 
        For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't 
        be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].

			/*sol:
				1. Early Exit if Lengths Don't Match:
          . If the number of words in words is not equal to the length of s, 
            return false immediately. This ensures they can potentially 
            form an acronym.
        2. Build the Acronym:
          . Use a StringBuilder to construct the acronym by appending the 
            first character of each word in words.
        3. Compare with s:
          . After constructing the acronym, compare it with s using .equals(). 
            Return true if they match, otherwise false.
        4. Return the Result:
          . The result of the comparison determines if s is an acronym of words.
