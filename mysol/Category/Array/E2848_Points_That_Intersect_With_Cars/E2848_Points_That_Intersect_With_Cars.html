				1. Using a Set to Track Covered Points:
          . A HashSet is used to store unique integer points that are 
            covered by any car.
          . Sets automatically handle duplicates, so adding the same 
            point multiple times has no effect.
        2. Iterating Through Each Car:
          . For each car represented by a range [start, end], all points 
            from start to end (inclusive) are added to the HashSet.
        3. Counting the Covered Points:
          . After processing all ranges, the size of the HashSet represents 
            the number of unique points covered by the cars.
        4. Return Result:
          . Return the size of the HashSet.
