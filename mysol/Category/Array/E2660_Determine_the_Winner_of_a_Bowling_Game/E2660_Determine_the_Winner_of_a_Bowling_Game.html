			 	You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2, 
        representing the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit 
        in a bowling game, respectively.

        The bowling game consists of n turns, and the number of pins in 
        each turn is exactly 10.

        Assume a player hits xi pins in the ith turn. The value of the 
        ith turn for the player is:

          . 2xi if the player hits 10 pins in either (i - 1)th or (i - 2)th turn.
          . Otherwise, it is xi.

        The score of the player is the sum of the values of their n turns.

        Return

          . 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
          . 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
          . 0 in case of a draw.
