			 	There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting 
        in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. 
        More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to 
        the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth 
        friend brings you to the 1st friend.

        The rules of the game are as follows:

        1st friend receives the ball.

          . After that, 1st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps 
            away from them in the clockwise direction.
          . After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to 
            the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
          . After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to 
            the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, 
            and so on and so forth.

        In other words, on the ith turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it 
        to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.

        The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.

        The losers of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game.

        Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the array answer, 
        which contains the losers of the game in the ascending order.

			/*sol:
				1. use a Set<Integer> called received to keep track of which friends 
            have received the ball.
        2. start with the 1st friend (currentFriend = 1) and begin passing the 
            ball according to the rules.
        3. calculate the next friend using the formula: 
            (currentFriend + steps * k - 1) % n + 1. This formula ensures that 
            the game wraps around in a circle.
        4. Once a friend receives the ball for the second time, the game ends.
        5. then find all the friends who did not receive the ball by checking 
            which friends are not in the received set.
