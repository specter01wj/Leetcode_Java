			 	You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is 
				the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. 
				Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

				A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. 
				The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.


				Example 1:

				Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
				Output: 6
				Explanation:
				1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
				2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
				Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

				Example 2:

				Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
				Output: 10
				Explanation: 
				1st customer has wealth = 6
				2nd customer has wealth = 10 
				3rd customer has wealth = 8
				The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

				Example 3:

				Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
				Output: 17
