				1. Handling Equal Elements:
          . When all elements are the same (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), 
            the difference (diff) will be 0. In this case, any missing number 
            should also be 0. The code returns the first element in such cases.
        2. Edge Case for Single Element:
          . If the array only contains one element, it directly returns that 
            element since there is no missing number in a single-element array.
