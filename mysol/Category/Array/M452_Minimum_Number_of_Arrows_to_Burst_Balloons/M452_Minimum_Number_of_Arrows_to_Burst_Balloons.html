			 	There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents 
        the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points 
        where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal 
        diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact 
        y-coordinates of the balloons.

        Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) 
        from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend 
        is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit 
        to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up 
        infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

        Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be 
        shot to burst all balloons.
