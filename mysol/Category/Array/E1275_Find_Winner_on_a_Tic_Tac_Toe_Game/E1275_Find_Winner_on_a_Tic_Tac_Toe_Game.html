			 	Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. 
				The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

				. Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
				. The first player A always places 'X' characters, 
				  while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
				. 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
				. The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, 
				  column, or diagonal.
				. The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
				. No more moves can be played if the game is over.

				Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that 
				the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. 
				return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). 
				In case the game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there are still movements to 
				play return "Pending".

				You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), 
				the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.


				Example 1:

				Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
				Output: "A"
				Explanation: A wins, they always play first.

				Example 2:

				Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
				Output: "B"
				Explanation: B wins.

				Example 3:

				Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
				Output: "Draw"
				Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.

			/*sol:
				Totally 8 ways to win: placement of 3 same characters on:
				1. 3 rows;
				2. 3 cols;
				3. 2 diagonals.
				Therefore we can use arrays of size 3 to accumulate the count of same characters on rows 
				and cols; use int variables to accumulate the count of same characters on diagonals.
				
				id: 0 for A, 1 for B;
				row[id][r]: the current number of characters that player id places on row r;
				col[id][c]: the current number of characters that player id places on column c;
				d1[id]: the current number of characters that player id places on main diagonal;
				d2[id]: the current number of characters that player id places on skew diagonal.
