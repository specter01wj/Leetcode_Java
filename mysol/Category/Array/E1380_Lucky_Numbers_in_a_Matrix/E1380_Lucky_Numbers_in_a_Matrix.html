			 	Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, 
				return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

				A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element 
				in its row and maximum in its column.


				Example 1:

				Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
				Output: [15]
				Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row 
				and the maximum in its column.

				Example 2:

				Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
				Output: [12]
				Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row 
				and the maximum in its column.

				Example 3:

				Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
				Output: [7]
				Explanation: 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row 
				and the maximum in its column.
