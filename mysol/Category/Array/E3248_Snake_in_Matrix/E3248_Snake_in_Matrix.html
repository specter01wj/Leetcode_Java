			 	There is a snake in an n x n matrix grid and can move in four 
        possible directions. Each cell in the grid is identified by 
        the position: grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j.

        The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

        You are given an integer n representing the size of the grid and 
        an array of strings commands where each command[i] is either "UP", 
        "RIGHT", "DOWN", and "LEFT". It's guaranteed that the snake will 
        remain within the grid boundaries throughout its movement.

        Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after 
        executing commands.
