			 	You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special 
				if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that 
				are greater than or equal to x.

				Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.

				Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven 
				that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [3,5]
				Output: 2
				Explanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [0,0]
				Output: -1
				Explanation: No numbers fit the criteria for x.
				If x = 0, there should be 0 numbers >= x, but there are 2.
				If x = 1, there should be 1 number >= x, but there are 0.
				If x = 2, there should be 2 numbers >= x, but there are 0.
				x cannot be greater since there are only 2 numbers in nums.

				Example 3:

				Input: nums = [0,4,3,0,4]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: There are 3 values that are greater than or equal to 3.

			/*sol:
				while counts[counts.length - 1] store the occurences for all numbers >= counts.length - 1
		    x is the max possible answer, so no need to count occurences for each number >= x
		    Consider the index i as x, and the goal is to find when (res = current number of elements >= x) == x
