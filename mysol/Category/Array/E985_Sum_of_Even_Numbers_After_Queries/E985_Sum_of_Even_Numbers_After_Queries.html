			 	We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.

				For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1], 
				we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is 
				the sum of the even values of A.

				(Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, 
				and each query permanently modifies the array A.)

				Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should 
				have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.

				 

				Example 1:

				Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
				Output: [8,6,2,4]
				Explanation: 
				At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
				After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], 
				and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
				After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], 
				and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
				After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], 
				and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
				After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], 
				and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.

			/*sol:
				Track sum of all even #s.
				There are 4 cases for odd / even property of A[k] and queries[i][0], where k = queries[i][1]:
				1). even and odd, lose an even item in A; sum need to deduct A[k];
				2). even and even, get a bigger even item in A; sum need to add queries[i][0](same as deduct A[k] first then add both);
				3). odd and odd, get a bigger even item in A; sum need to add both;
				4). odd and even, no influence on even items in A;
				
				Therefore, we can simplify the above as following procedure:
				
				find sum of all even #s;
				for each queries, check the item in A and after-added-up value, if
				a) the item in A is even, deduct it from sum; according to 1) & 2).
				b) after-added-up we have an even value, then add the new value to sum; according to 2) & 3).
