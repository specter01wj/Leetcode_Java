			 	A dieter consumes calories[i] calories on the i-th day. 

        Given an integer k, for every consecutive sequence of k 
        days (calories[i], calories[i+1], ..., calories[i+k-1] 
        for all 0 <= i <= n-k), they look at T, the total calories 
        consumed during that sequence of k days (calories[i] + 
        calories[i+1] + ... + calories[i+k-1]):

        . If T < lower, they performed poorly on their diet and lose 1 point; 
        . If T > upper, they performed well on their diet and gain 1 point;
        . Otherwise, they performed normally and there is no change in points.

        Initially, the dieter has zero points. Return the total number 
        of points the dieter has after dieting for calories.length days.

			/*sol:
				1. Initial Sum Calculation:
          . We start by calculating the sum of the first k days (first window) and evaluate whether 
            this sum is below lower, above upper, or in between. We adjust the points accordingly.
        2. Sliding Window Technique:
          . We then slide the window across the array by one element at a time.
          . For each new element added to the window, we subtract the element that is no longer in 
            the window (calories[i - k]) and add the new element (calories[i]).
          . We evaluate the sum for each window and update the points.
        3. Edge Cases:
          . The code handles edge cases, such as when the sum of a window is exactly on the boundary 
            (lower or upper), ensuring no points are added or subtracted in those cases.
