			 	Given an array of integers nums, you can perform any number of 
        operations on this array.

        In each operation, you can:

          . Choose a prefix of the array.
          . Choose an integer k (which can be negative) and add k to each element in the chosen prefix.

        A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of

				1. int operations = 0:
          . Stores the count of operations needed to make all elements equal.
        2. Traverse the array from right to left (index i from n - 2 to 0):
          . This ensures we always compare each element with the one that follows it, simulating working backwards from the goal.
        3. Compare nums[i] and nums[i + 1]:
          . If they are not equal, it means we need to perform an operation to bring nums[i] in line with nums[i + 1].
          . This simulates choosing a prefix up to index i and adding a value to match the next number.
        4. Increment operations when a difference is found:
          . Each difference between adjacent values indicates one required operation.
          . This is the minimal number of operations due to the allowed prefix operation rule.
        5. Return operations:
          . The total number of value changes from right to left equals the minimum number of operations needed.
