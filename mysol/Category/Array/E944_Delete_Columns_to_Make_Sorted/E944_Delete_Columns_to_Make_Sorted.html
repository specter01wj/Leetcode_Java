			/*
			 	You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

				The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. 
				For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:

				abc
				bce
				cae

				You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. 
				In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') 
				are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

				Return the number of columns that you will delete.


				Example 1:

				Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
				  cba
				  daf
				  ghi
				Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to 
				delete 1 column.

				Example 2:

				Input: strs = ["a","b"]
				Output: 0
				Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
				  a
				  b
				Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns.

				Example 3:

				Input: strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
				  zyx
				  wvu
				  tsr
				All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.
