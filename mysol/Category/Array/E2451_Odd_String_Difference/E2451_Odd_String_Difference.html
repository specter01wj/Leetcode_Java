			 	You are given an array of equal-length strings words. 
        Assume that the length of each string is n.

        Each string words[i] can be converted into a difference integer 
        array difference[i] of length n - 1 where difference[i][j] = 
        words[i][j+1] - words[i][j] where 0 <= j <= n - 2. 
        Note that the difference between two letters is the difference 
        between their positions in the alphabet i.e. the position of 
        'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and 'z' is 25.

          . For example, for the string "acb", the difference integer array is [2 - 0, 1 - 2] = [2, -1].

        All the strings in words have the same difference integer array, except one. 
        You should find that string.

        Return the string in words that has different difference integer array.
