			 	Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings 
				that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.


				Example 1:

				Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
				Output: 2
				Explanation:
				- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
				- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
				- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
				- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
				Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

				Example 2:

				Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
				Output: 0
				Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

				Example 3:

				Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
