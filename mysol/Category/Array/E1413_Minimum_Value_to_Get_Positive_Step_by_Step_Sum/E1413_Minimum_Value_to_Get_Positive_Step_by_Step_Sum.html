			 	Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value startValue.

				In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in 
				nums (from left to right).

				Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is 
				never less than 1.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
				Output: 5
				Explanation: If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by step sum 
				is less than 1.
				step by step sum
				startValue = 4 | startValue = 5 | nums
				  (4 -3 ) = 1  | (5 -3 ) = 2    |  -3
				  (1 +2 ) = 3  | (2 +2 ) = 4    |   2
				  (3 -3 ) = 0  | (4 -3 ) = 1    |  -3
				  (0 +4 ) = 4  | (1 +4 ) = 5    |   4
				  (4 +2 ) = 6  | (5 +2 ) = 7    |   2

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [1,2]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: Minimum start value should be positive. 

				Example 3:

				Input: nums = [1,-2,-3]
				Output: 5

			/*sol:
				This question uses the concept of Prefix Sum and can be optimally solved in 
			  One-Pass w/ Constant-Space.
				To solve this question, we need to find the Minimum Prefix Sum <= 0 ending at each index.
				At an index i:
				prefixSum = Sum of first i elements.
				To keep track of the minimum prefix sum, we use minVal. It is initially assigned to zero 
				so that we can find the minimum prefix sum <= 0.
				Final Minimum Positive startValue will be 1 - Minimum Prefix Sum as this will ensure 
				that the prefix sum is always >= 1 at every index of the input array.
