			 	Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in 
				non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). 
				Otherwise, return false.

				There may be duplicates in the original array.

				Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length 
				such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
				Output: true
				Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
				You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
				Output: false
				Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.

				Example 3:

				Input: nums = [1,2,3]
				Output: true
				Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
				You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.
