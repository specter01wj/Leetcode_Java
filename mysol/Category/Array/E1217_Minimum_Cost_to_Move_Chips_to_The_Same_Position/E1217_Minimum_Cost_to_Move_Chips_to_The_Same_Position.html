			 	We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].

				We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, 
				we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:

				. position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
				. position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
				Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.


				Example 1:

				Input: position = [1,2,3]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
				Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
				Total cost is 1.

				Example 2:

				Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
				Output: 2
				Explanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. 
				Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.

				Example 3:

				Input: position = [1,1000000000]
				Output: 1
