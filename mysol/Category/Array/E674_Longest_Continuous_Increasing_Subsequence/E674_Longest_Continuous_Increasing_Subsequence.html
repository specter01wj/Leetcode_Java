			 	Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the 
				longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). 
				The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

				A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and 
				r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], 
				nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

				 

				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: 
				The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
				Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous 
				as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element 4.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: 
				The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. 
				Note that it must be strictly increasing.

				The idea is to use cnt to record the length of the current 
		    continuous increasing subsequence which ends with nums[i], 
		    and use res to record the maximum cnt.
