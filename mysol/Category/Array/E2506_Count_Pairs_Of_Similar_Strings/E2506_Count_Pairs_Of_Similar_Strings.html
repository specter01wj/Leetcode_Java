			 	You are given a 0-indexed string array words.

				1. Represent Each Word as a Set of Characters:
          . For each word, create a representation that captures the set of 
            unique characters it contains.
          . Since the words consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'), 
            we can use a 26-bit integer where each bit represents a character.
        2. Use a HashMap to Count Similar Words:
          . Use a HashMap to map each unique character set representation to 
            the number of times it appears.
          . For example, if two words have the same character set, they will 
            have the same key in the map.
        3. Calculate the Number of Pairs:
          . For each unique character set with a frequency greater than 1, 
            calculate the number of pairs using the combination formula: 
            count * (count - 1) / 2.
          . Sum up the pairs for all character sets.
