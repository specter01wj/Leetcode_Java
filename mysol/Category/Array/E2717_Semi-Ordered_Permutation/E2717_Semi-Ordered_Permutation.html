			 	You are given a 0-indexed permutation of n integers nums.

        A permutation is called semi-ordered if the first number equals 1 
        and the last number equals n. You can perform the below operation 
        as many times as you want until you make nums a semi-ordered permutation:

				1. Finding Positions:
          . We locate the positions of 1 (index1) and n (indexN) in the nums array.
        2. Calculating Moves:
          . To bring 1 to the beginning, it requires index1 moves.
          . To bring n to the end, it requires (n - 1 - indexN) moves.
          . The sum of these gives us the minimum number of moves needed 
            if no overlap occurs between 1 and n.
        3. Overlap Condition:
          . If 1 appears before n in the array, no overlap occurs.
          . If 1 appears after n, we subtract 1 from the total because one move overlaps.
