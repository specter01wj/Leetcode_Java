			/*sol:
				1. Sort Each Row: Since we are required to delete the greatest value from 
            each row in every operation, sorting each row in ascending order will 
            help us easily access these values. After sorting, the largest values 
            will be at the end of each row.
        2. Iterate Through Columns: We then iterate through each column from left 
            to right. At each column index k, we pick the element grid[i][k] from 
            each row i.	
        3. Find Maximum in Each Step: For each column k, we find the maximum value 
            among the selected elements from all rows. This maximum represents the 
            greatest value deleted in that operation.	
        4. Accumulate the Answer: We add the maximum value found in each step to 
            our answer.
        5. Return the Result: After iterating through all columns, we return the 
            accumulated answer.
