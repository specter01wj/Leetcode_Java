				1. We use a HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Integer, Integer>> to track the count of each color picked by each player.
        2. We iterate over the pick array and populate this map.
        3. After gathering counts, we check each player's color counts to see if they exceed their player number.
        4. If any color count surpasses the required threshold (player index + 1), the player is counted as a winner.
        5. The final count of winning players is returned.
