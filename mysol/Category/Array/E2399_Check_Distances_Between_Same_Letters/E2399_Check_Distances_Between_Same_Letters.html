			 	You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase 
        English letters, where each letter in s appears exactly twice. 
        You are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.

        Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 
        (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).

        two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. If the ith 
        letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.

        Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.
