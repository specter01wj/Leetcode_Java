			 	A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space 
				with no leading or trailing spaces.

				You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] 
				represents a single sentence.

				Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.


				Example 1:

				Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
				Output: 6
				Explanation: 
				- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
				- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
				- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
				Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

				Example 2:

				Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
				In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
