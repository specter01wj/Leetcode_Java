				1. Tracking the maximum ones: initialize two variables: maxOnes to 
            store the maximum count of 1s, and rowIndex to store the index of 
            the row with that count.
        2. Counting ones in each row: loop through each row and count the number 
            of 1s in that row.
        3. Updating the result: If the count of 1s in the current row is greater 
            than maxOnes, update both maxOnes and rowIndex. 
            If multiple rows have the same number of ones, the row with the smaller 
            index is automatically selected since only update when a row has a 
            strictly greater count.
        4. Return the result: return the index of the row with the maximum ones 
            and the count of ones in that row.
