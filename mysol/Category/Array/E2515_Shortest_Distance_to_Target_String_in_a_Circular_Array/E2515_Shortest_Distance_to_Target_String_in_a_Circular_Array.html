			 	You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. 
        A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.

          . Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the 
            previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is 
            the length of words.

        Starting from startIndex, you can move to either the next word or the previous 
        word with 1 step at a time.

        Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. 
        If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.

			/*sol:
				1. Initialization:
          . n is the length of the words array.
          . minDistance is initialized to the maximum integer value to keep track of the minimum distance found.
        2. Iterating Through the Array:
          . We loop through each index i in the words array.
          . If words[i] equals the target, we proceed to calculate the distance.
        3. Calculating Distances:
          . Forward Distance:
            . Calculated using (i - startIndex + n) % n.
            . This formula accounts for the circular nature of the array and ensures a non-negative result.
          . Backward Distance:
            . Calculated using (startIndex - i + n) % n.
            . Similarly adjusted for the circular array.
          . We take the minimum of the forward and backward distances as the shortest path to the current target.
        4. Updating Minimum Distance:
          . We compare the calculated distance with minDistance and update minDistance if the new distance is smaller.
        5. Final Result:
          . After checking all occurrences of the target, if minDistance remains Integer.MAX_VALUE, it means the target 
            was not found in the array, so we return -1.
          . Otherwise, we return the minDistance, which is the shortest distance to reach the target from the startIndex.
