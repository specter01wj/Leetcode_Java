			 	Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest 
				number and largest number in nums.

				The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that 
				evenly divides both numbers.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
				Output: 2
				Explanation:
				The smallest number in nums is 2.
				The largest number in nums is 10.
				The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
				Output: 1
				Explanation:
				The smallest number in nums is 3.
				The largest number in nums is 8.
				The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.

				Example 3:

				Input: nums = [3,3]
				Output: 3
				Explanation:
				The smallest number in nums is 3.
				The largest number in nums is 3.
				The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.

			/*sol:
				It is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers 
			  does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.
				Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this 
				process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal.
				When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers
