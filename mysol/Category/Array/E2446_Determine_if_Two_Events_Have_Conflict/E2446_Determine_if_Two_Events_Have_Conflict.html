				1. Helper function timeToMinutes: This function converts the "HH:MM"

            the time string into hours and minutes, then converts each to 
            integers and calculates the total minutes.
        2. Time comparison: After converting the event times into minutes, 
          we check for overlaps:
          . If the end time of the first event is before the start time of 
            the second event (end1 < start2) or the end time of the second 
            event is before the start time of the first event (end2 < start1), 
            there is no conflict.
          . If neither condition holds, the events overlap, and we return true.
