			 	You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where words[i] consists of lowercase 
				English letters.

				In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] 
				and words[i] are anagrams, and delete words[i] from words. Keep performing this operation 
				as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

				Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices 
				for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

				An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or 
				phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "dacb" is an anagram 
				of "abdc".


				Example 1:

				Input: words = ["abba","baba","bbaa","cd","cd"]
				Output: ["abba","cd"]
				Explanation:
				One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
				- Since words[2] = "bbaa" and words[1] = "baba" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
				  Now words = ["abba","baba","cd","cd"].
				- Since words[1] = "baba" and words[0] = "abba" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
				  Now words = ["abba","cd","cd"].
				- Since words[2] = "cd" and words[1] = "cd" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
				  Now words = ["abba","cd"].
				We can no longer perform any operations, so ["abba","cd"] is the final answer.


				Example 2:

				Input: words = ["a","b","c","d","e"]
				Output: ["a","b","c","d","e"]
				Explanation:
				No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.

			/*sol:
				Iterate through the words array, and for each word, check if it's an anagram of the 
		    previous word. If it is, you remove it from the list. 
		    Note that since removing an element will alter the structure of the list, 
		    we need to adjust our loop counter accordingly.
				To check if two words are anagrams, you can sort their characters and see if they match.
