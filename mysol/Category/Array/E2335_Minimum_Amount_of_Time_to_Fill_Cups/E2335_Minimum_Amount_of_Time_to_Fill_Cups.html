			 	You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. 
        Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, 
        or 1 cup of any type of water.

        You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], 
        amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water 
        cups you need to fill respectively. 
        Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.


        Example 1:

        Input: amount = [1,4,2]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
        Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
        Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
        Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
        Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
        It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.


        Example 2:

        Input: amount = [5,4,4]
        Output: 7
        Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
        Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
        Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
        Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
        Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.
        Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
        Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
        Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.
        Example 3:

        Input: amount = [5,0,0]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Every second, we fill up a cold cup.
