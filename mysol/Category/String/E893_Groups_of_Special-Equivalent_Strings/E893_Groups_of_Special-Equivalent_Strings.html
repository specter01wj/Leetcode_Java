			/*You are given an array A of strings.

				A move onto S consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of S, 
				or any two odd indexed characters of S.

				Two strings S and T are special-equivalent if after any number of moves 
				onto S, S == T.

				For example, S = "zzxy" and T = "xyzz" are special-equivalent because 
				we may make the moves "zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz" that swap S[0] and S[2], 
				then S[1] and S[3].

				Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from A is a non-empty subset 
				of A such that:

				1. Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
				2. The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S not 
				in the group such that S is special equivalent to every string in the group)

				Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from A.

				 
				Example 1:

				Input: ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: 
				One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special 
				equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special 
				equivalent to these.

				The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].  Note that in 
				particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".

				Example 2:

				Input: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
				Output: 3
