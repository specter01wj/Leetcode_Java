			 	You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. 
				A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal 
				letters and removing them.

				We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

				Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. 
				It can be proven that the answer is unique.


				Example 1:

				Input: s = "abbaca"
				Output: "ca"
				Explanation: 
				For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are 
				adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  
				The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", 
				of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "azxxzy"
				Output: "ay"

			/*sol:
				i refers to the index to set next character in the output string.
				j refers to the index of current iteration in the input string.
				
				Iterate characters of S one by one by increasing j.
				
				If S[j] is same as the current last character S[i - 1],
				we remove duplicates by doing i -= 2.
				
				If S[j] is different as the current last character S[i - 1],
				we set S[i] = S[j] and increment i++.
