			 	You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] 
				describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. 
				You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

				The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

					.ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
					.ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
					.ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
					
				Return the number of items that match the given rule.


				Example 1:

				Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], 
				ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
				Output: 1
				Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, 
				which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

				Example 2:

				Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], 
				ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
				Output: 2
				Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, 
				which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. 
				Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
