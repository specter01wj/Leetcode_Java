			/*sol:
			Approach 1: Linear time solution
			The best possible solution here could be of a linear time because to 
			ensure that the character is unique you have to check the whole string anyway.
			
			The idea is to go through the string and save in a hash map the number of 
			times each character appears in the string. That would take O(N) time, 
			where N is a number of characters in the string.
			
			And then we go through the string the second time, this time we use the 
			hash map as a reference to check if a character is unique or not.
			If the character is unique, one could just return its index. 
			The complexity of the second iteration is O(N) as well.
