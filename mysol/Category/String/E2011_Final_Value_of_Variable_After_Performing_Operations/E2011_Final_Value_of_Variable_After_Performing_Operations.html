			/*
			 	There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

					.++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
					.--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.

				Initially, the value of X is 0.

				Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, 
				return the final value of X after performing all the operations.


				Example 1:

				Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
				Initially, X = 0.
				--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
				X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
				X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

				Example 2:

				Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
				Initially, X = 0.
				++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
				++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
				X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.

				Example 3:

				Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
				Output: 0
				Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
				Initially, X = 0.
				X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
				++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
				--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
				X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
