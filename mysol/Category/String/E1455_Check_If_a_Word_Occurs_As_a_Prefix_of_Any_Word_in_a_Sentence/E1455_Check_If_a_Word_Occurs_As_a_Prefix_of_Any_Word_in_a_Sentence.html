			/*
			 	Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, 
				and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

				Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a 
				prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return 
				the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

				A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.


				Example 1:

				Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
				Output: 4
				Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

				Example 2:

				Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
				Output: 2
				Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, 
				but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

				Example 3:

				Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
				Output: -1
				Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
