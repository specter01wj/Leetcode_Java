			 	A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

					.It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
					.It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
					.It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
					
				We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

					.depth("") = 0
					.depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
					.depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
					.depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

				For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), 
				and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

				Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.


				Example 1:

				Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
				Output: 3
				Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
				Output: 3

				Ignore digits and signs,
				only count the current open parentheses cur.
				The depth equals to the maximum open parentheses.
