			/*You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited 
				string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

				There are two types of logs:

				Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase 
							English letters.
				Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

				Reorder these logs so that:

				1. The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
				2. The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. 
				   If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically 
				   by their identifiers.
				3. The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

				Return the final order of the logs.

				 

				Example 1:

				Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig",
								"let3 art zero"]
				Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1",
						"dig2 3 6"]
				Explanation:
				The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", 
				"art zero", "own kit dig".
				The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".

				Example 2:

				Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
				Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

			/*sol:
			1. guaranteed to have a word following an identifier (allows me to 
		    use indexOf ' ' freely).
			2. letter logs need to be ordered lexicographically, so we can use 
				built in compare function when we know we have two.
			3. number logs need to be sorted naturally, so we just say they're 
				all "equal" to eachother and trust java's built in sort feature 
				to be stable.
			4. number logs need to be after letter logs, so once we find out 
				they're different, we return one of the other and short-circuit.
