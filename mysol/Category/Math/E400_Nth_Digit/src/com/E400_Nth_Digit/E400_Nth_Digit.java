/*Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:

Input:
3

Output:
3
Example 2:

Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, 
which is part of the number 10.*/

		int input = 11;

	}
	
	/*
    solution:
    The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. 
    We need to find the largest peak following the smallest valley. 
    We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding 
    to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between 
    selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.
