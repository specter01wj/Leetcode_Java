			 	We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

        I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

        Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I 
        picked is higher or lower than your guess.

        You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three 
        possible results:

         .-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
         .1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
         .0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
        
         Return the number that I picked.
