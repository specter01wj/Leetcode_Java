			 	Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a throttled version 
        of that function.

        A throttled function is first called without delay and then, for a time interval 
        of t milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest function 
        arguments provided to call fn with them after the end of the delay.

        For instance, t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 40ms, and 60ms. 
        The first function call would block calling functions for the following t milliseconds. 
        The second function call would save arguments, and the third call arguments 
        should overwrite currently stored arguments from the second call because the 
        second and third calls are called before 80ms. Once the delay has passed, 
        the throttled function should be called with the latest arguments provided 
        during the delay period, and it should also create another delay period of 80ms + t.

        The above diagram shows how throttle will transform events. 
        Each rectangle represents 100ms and the throttle time is 400ms. Each color 
        represents a different set of inputs.
