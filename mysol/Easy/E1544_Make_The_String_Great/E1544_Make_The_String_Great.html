			 	Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.

				A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:

				 .0 <= i <= s.length - 2
				 .s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.

				To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad 
				and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

				Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under 
				the given constraints.

				Notice that an empty string is also good.


				Example 1:

				Input: s = "leEeetcode"
				Output: "leetcode"
				Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, 
				both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "abBAcC"
				Output: ""
				Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
				"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
				"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""

				Example 3:

				Input: s = "s"
				Output: "s"

			$(document).ready(function(){

				/**
		     * @param s: a string
		     * @return: the string after making it good
		     */
				let makeGood = function(s) {
					const stack = [''];

					for(let c of s) {
						let top = stack[stack.length - 1];
						if (top.toLowerCase() === c.toLowerCase() && top != c) {
							stack.pop();
						} else {
							stack.push(c);
						}
					}

					return stack.join('');
      	};

				let str = "leEeetcode";
				let tt1 = makeGood(str);
				$('#t1').html('<h2>Input1: ' + str + '<br>Results: ' + tt1 + '</h2>');
			});

			/*sol:
				The difference between the any lowercase and uppercase alphabet is 32. 
		    Example - ASCII value of a is 97 and A is 65 , 97-65 = 32
		    Using same trick, we can delete adjacent characters with absolute difference of 32.
		    If current character is A and a is at top of stack, we pop a and dont insert A.
				Otherwise, we insert the current character in stack.
				Collect result in String at the end.
