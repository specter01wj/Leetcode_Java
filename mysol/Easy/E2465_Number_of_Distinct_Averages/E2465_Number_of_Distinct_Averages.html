			/*sol:
				1. Sorting the Array: We first sort the array. After sorting, 
            we can easily access the minimum element from the left 
            (starting at index 0) and the maximum element from the right 
            (starting at the last index).
        2. Two-Pointer Approach: We use two pointers (left and right) to 
          pick the smallest and largest numbers, calculate their average, 
          and add that average to a Set<Double> to ensure only distinct 
          averages are stored.
        3. Set for Distinct Averages: A HashSet is used to store the distinct 
          averages, which automatically handles any duplicates.
        4. Loop: We continue this process of removing the minimum and maximum 
          until the pointers meet or cross.
        5. Return Result: The size of the set represents the number of distinct averages.
