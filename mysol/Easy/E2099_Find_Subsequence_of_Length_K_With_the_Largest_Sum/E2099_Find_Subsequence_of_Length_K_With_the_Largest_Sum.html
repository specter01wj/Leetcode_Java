			 	You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. 
				You want to find a subsequence of nums of length k that has the largest sum.

				Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.

				A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting 
				some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
				Output: [3,3]
				Explanation:
				The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
				Output: [-1,3,4]
				Explanation: 
				The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

				Example 3:

				Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
				Output: [3,4]
				Explanation:
				The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
				Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
