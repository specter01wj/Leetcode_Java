			/*sol:
				1. Alternating Color Choice:
          . The odd rows (1st, 3rd, 5th, …) use the primary color (whichever is passed first).
          . The even rows (2nd, 4th, 6th, …) use the secondary color.
        2. Two Calls:
          . Math.max(buildTriangle(red, blue), buildTriangle(blue, red)) 
          ensures that we try both starting color arrangements and return 
          the best result.
        3. Loop Process:
          . Start with row 1, check if enough balls are available.
          . Deduct balls and increase the height.
          . Repeat for the next row until a row cannot be formed.
