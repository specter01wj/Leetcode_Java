			/*
			 	You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the 
				weight of the ith stone.

				We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose 
				the heaviest two stones and smash them together. 
				Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. 
				The result of this smash is:

				. If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
				. If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of 
					weight y has new weight y - x.

				At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

				Return the weight of the last remaining stone. 
				If there are no stones left, return 0.


				Example 1:

				Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: 
				We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
				we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
				we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
				we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's 
				the value of the last stone.

				Example 2:

				Input: stones = [1]
				Output: 1
