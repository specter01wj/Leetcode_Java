			 	There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is 
				beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors 
				of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.

				Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

				The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) 
				is the absolute value of x.


				Example 1:


				Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
				Output: 3
				Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
				The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
				House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
				Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

				Example 2:


				Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]
				Output: 4
				Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
				The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
				House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.

				Example 3:

				Input: colors = [0,1]
				Output: 1
				Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
				House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.
