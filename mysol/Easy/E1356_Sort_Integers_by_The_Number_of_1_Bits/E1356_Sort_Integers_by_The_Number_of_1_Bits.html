			 	You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending 
				order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or 
				more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

				Return the array after sorting it.


				Example 1:

				Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
				Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
				Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
				[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
				[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
				[7] has 3 bits.
				The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

				Example 2:

				Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
				Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
				Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, 
				you should just sort them in ascending order.

			/*sol:
				Since the input values can range from 0 to 10000, we can add to each element 
	     on the array the value of the bit count (number of 1s) multiplied by 10001.
	     10001 is not a magic number, it is merely the max possible number the array 
	     may have + 1, which ensures that the bit count has the maximum priority,
	     and that we do not mistakenly erase a number when reverting the array back 
	     to its original values (after sorting).
