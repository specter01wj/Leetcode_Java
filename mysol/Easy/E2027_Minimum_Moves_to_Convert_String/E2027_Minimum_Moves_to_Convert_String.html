			 	You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.

				A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting 
				them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.

				Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.


				Example 1:

				Input: s = "XXX"
				Output: 1
				Explanation: XXX -> OOO
				We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "XXOX"
				Output: 2
				Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
				We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
				Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.

				Example 3:

				Input: s = "OOOO"
				Output: 0
				Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.
