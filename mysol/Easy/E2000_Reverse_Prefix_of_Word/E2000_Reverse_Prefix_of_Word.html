			 	Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of 
				word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence 
				of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

					.For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse 
					the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting 
					string will be "dcbaefd".

				Return the resulting string.


				Example 1:

				Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
				Output: "dcbaefd"
				Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
				Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

				Example 2:

				Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
				Output: "zxyxxe"
				Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
				Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".

				Example 3:

				Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
				Output: "abcd"
				Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
				You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
