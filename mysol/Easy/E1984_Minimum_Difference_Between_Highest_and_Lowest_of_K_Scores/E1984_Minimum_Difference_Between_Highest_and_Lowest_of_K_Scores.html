			 	You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the 
				score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

				Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference 
				between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

				Return the minimum possible difference.


				Example 1:

				Input: nums = [90], k = 1
				Output: 0
				Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
				- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
				The minimum possible difference is 0.

				Example 2:

				Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
				Output: 2
				Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
				- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
				The minimum possible difference is 2.
