			 	Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

				The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and 
				finished it at time endTime[i].

				Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. 
				More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the 
				interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.


				Example 1:

				Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
				Output: 1
				Explanation: We have 3 students where:
				The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 
				and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
				The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 
				and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
				The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 
				and was the only student doing homework at time 4.

				Example 2:

				Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
				Output: 1
				Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
