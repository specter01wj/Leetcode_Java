			 	Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of 
				strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

				A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


				Example 1:

				Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
				Output: 3
				Explanation:
				- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
				- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
				- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
				- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
				3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

				Example 2:

				Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
				Output: 2
				Explanation:
				- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
				- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
				- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
				2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

				Example 3:

				Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
				Output: 3
				Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
