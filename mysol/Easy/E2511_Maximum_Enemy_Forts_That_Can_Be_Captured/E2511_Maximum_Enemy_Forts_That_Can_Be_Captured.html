			 	You are given a 0-indexed integer array forts of length n representing 
        the positions of several forts. forts[i] can be -1, 0, or 1 where:

          . -1 represents there is no fort at the ith position.
          . 0 indicates there is an enemy fort at the ith position.
          . 1 indicates the fort at the ith the position is under your command.

        Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position i to an empty position j such that:

          . 0 <= i, j <= n - 1
          . The army travels over enemy forts only. Formally, for all k where min(i,j) < k < max(i,j), forts[k] == 0.

        While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are captured.

        Return the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured. 
        In case it is impossible to move your army, or you do not have any fort 
        under your command, return 0.

			/*sol:
				1. Initialize Variables:
          . max_captured: To keep track of the maximum number of enemy forts captured.
          . prev: To store the index of the last non-zero fort encountered.
        2. Iterate Through the Array:
          . For each position i in the array:
            . If forts[i] is not 0, it could be a starting or ending point of a move.
            . If we have a previous non-zero fort (prev != -1), and the current fort 
              is of the opposite type (forts[prev] != forts[i]), we calculate the 
              number of enemy forts between them.
            . We update max_captured if the calculated number is greater.
        3. Ensure Valid Movement:
          . The positions between prev and i (excluding prev and i) must all be enemy forts (0).
          . Since we only update prev when we encounter a non-zero fort, any non-zero fort 
            between prev and i would have reset prev, ensuring that all forts in between are enemy forts.
        4. Return the Result:
          . After iterating through the array, we return the max_captured value.
