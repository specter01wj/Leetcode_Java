			 	Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m 
				that is repeated k or more times.

				A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of 
				one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. 
				A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

				Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, 
				otherwise return false.


				Example 1:

				Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
				Output: true
				Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. 
				Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.

				Example 2:

				Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
				Output: true
				Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. 
				Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.

				Example 3:

				Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
				Output: false
				Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. 
				There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.
