			 	You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, 
				and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) 
				array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

				The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first 
				row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 
				(inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

				Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 
				2D array if it is impossible.


				Example 1:


				Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
				Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
				Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
				The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
				The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

				Example 2:

				Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
				Output: [[1,2,3]]
				Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
				Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.

				Example 3:

				Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
				Output: []
				Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
				It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.
