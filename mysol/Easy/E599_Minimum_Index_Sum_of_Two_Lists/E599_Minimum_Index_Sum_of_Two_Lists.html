			/*Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, 
				and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

				You need to help them find out their common interest with the least 
				list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of 
				them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.


				Example 1:

				Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], 
				list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
				Output: ["Shogun"]
				Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

				Example 2:

				Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], 
				list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
				Output: ["Shogun"]
				Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index 
				sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
