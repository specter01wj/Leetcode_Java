			 	In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. 
				There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

				If the town judge exists, then:

				1. The town judge trusts nobody.
				2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
				3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

				You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing 
				that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

				Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can 
				be identified, or return -1 otherwise.


				Example 1:

				Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
				Output: 2

				Example 2:

				Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
				Output: 3

				Example 3:

				Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
				Output: -1
