			 	You are given an object street of class Street that represents a 
        circular street and a positive integer k which represents a maximum 
        bound for the number of houses in that street (in other words, 
        the number of houses is less than or equal to k). Houses' doors 
        could be open or closed initially.

        Initially, you are standing in front of a door to a house on this street. 
        Your task is to count the number of houses in the street.

        The class Street contains the following functions which may help you:

          . void openDoor(): Open the door of the house you are in front of.
          . void closeDoor(): Close the door of the house you are in front of.
          . boolean isDoorOpen(): Returns true if the door of the current house is open and false otherwise.
          . void moveRight(): Move to the right house.
          . void moveLeft(): Move to the left house.

        Return ans which represents the number of houses on this street.

			/*sol:
				1. First Loop (Setup Phase):
          . We iterate k times, moving around the circular street to ensure 
            that if there are fewer than k houses, we have fully circled around.
          . For each house, if the door is open, we close it. This ensures a 
            consistent starting state for counting.
        2. Marking the Starting Point:
          . After the initial loop, we open the current door and move to the 
            next house. This marks the starting point with an open door, 
            making it easy to detect when we have completed a full loop.
        3. Counting Houses:
          . We initialize ans to 0 and then move right, counting each house 
            until we encounter the marked starting house with an open door.
          . When we reach the open door, it signifies a complete loop, and we 
            return ans + 1 (to include the starting house).
