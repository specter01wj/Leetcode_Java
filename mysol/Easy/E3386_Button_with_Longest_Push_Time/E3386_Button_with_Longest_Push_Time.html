			 	You are given a 2D array events which represents a sequence of events 
        where a child pushes a series of buttons on a keyboard.

        Each events[i] = [indexi, timei] indicates that the button at index 
        indexi was pressed at time timei.

          . The array is sorted in increasing order of time.
          . The time taken to press a button is the difference in time between 
            consecutive button presses. The time for the first button is simply 
            the time at which it was pressed.

        Return the index of the button that took the longest time to push. 
        If multiple buttons have the same longest time, return the button with 
        the smallest index.

        2. First Event:
          . It has no previous event, so its duration is simply events[0][1].
        3. Loop Through Events from i=1:
          . Calculate duration = events[i][1] - events[i-1][1].
          . Compare with current longestDuration.
            . If duration > longestDuration: update both longestDuration and buttonIndex.
            . If duration == longestDuration and current button index is smaller, update buttonIndex.
        4. Return Result:
          . The button with the longest push time, or the smallest index in case of tie.
