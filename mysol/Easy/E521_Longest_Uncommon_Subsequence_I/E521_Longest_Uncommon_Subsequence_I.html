			/*Given two strings a and b, find the length of the longest uncommon 
				subsequence between them.

				A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after 
				deleting any number of characters from s. 
				For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete 
				the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". 
				Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

				An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is 
				a subsequence of one but not the other.

				Return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. 
				If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

				 

				Example 1:

				Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
				Output: 3
				Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" 
				because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
				Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.

				Example 2:

				Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
				Output: 3
				Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".

				Example 3:

				Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
				Output: -1
				Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence 
				of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also 
				a subsequence of string a.

			当两个串的长度不相等时，返回较长串的长度，否则返回-1。
