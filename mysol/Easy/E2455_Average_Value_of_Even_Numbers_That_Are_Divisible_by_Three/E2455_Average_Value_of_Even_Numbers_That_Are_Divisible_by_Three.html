				1. Loop through the array: Check each number to see if it satisfies 
            the conditions of being even and divisible by 3.
        2. Sum and count: Accumulate the numbers that meet the condition and 
            track how many such numbers are found.
        3. Return result: If at least one number is found, calculate the 
            average by dividing the sum by the count, rounding down naturally 
            using integer division. If no such numbers are found, return 0.
