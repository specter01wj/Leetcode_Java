			 	In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive 
				groups of the same character.

				For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", 
				"bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".

				A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and 
				end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. 
				In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].

				A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.

				Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order 
				by start index.

				 

				Example 1:

				Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
				Output: [[3,6]]
				Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "abc"
				Output: []
				Explanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.

				Example 3:

				Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
				Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
				Explanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".

				Example 4:

				Input: s = "aba"
				Output: []
