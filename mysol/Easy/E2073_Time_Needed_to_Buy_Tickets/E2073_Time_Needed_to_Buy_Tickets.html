			 	There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person 
				is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.

				You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number 
				of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].

				Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket 
				at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) 
				in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, 
				the person will leave the line.

				Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.


				Example 1:

				Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
				Output: 6
				Explanation: 
				- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
				- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
				The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.

				Example 2:

				Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
				Output: 8
				Explanation:
				- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
				- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
				The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.
