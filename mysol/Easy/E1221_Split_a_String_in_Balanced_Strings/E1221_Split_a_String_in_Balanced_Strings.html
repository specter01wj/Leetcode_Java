			 	Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

				Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

				Each substring is balanced.
				Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.


				Example 1:

				Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
				Output: 4
				Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", 
					each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

				Example 2:

				Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
				Output: 2
				Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", 
					each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
					Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", 
					because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

				Example 3:

				Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
				Output: 1
				Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
