			/*
			 	There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged 
				in a circle with a pointer. A character can only be typed if the pointer is 
				pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character 'a'.


				Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

				Move the pointer one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
				Type the character the pointer is currently on.
				Given a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in word.


				Example 1:

				Input: word = "abc"
				Output: 5
				Explanation: 
				The characters are printed as follows:
				- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
				- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
				- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

				Example 2:

				Input: word = "bza"
				Output: 7
				Explanation:
				The characters are printed as follows:
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
				- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
				- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
				- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.

				Example 3:

				Input: word = "zjpc"
				Output: 34
				Explanation:
				The characters are printed as follows:
				- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
				- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
				- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
				- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
				- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
				- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

			/*sol:
				1. Initialize the prev as a;
				2. Traverse the word, for each character, compute the distances from 
				current character, cur, to previous one, prev, clockwise and counter-clockwise, 
				respectively; Choose the minimum between them;
				3. Count in 1 second for each typing character; therefore we can initialize cnt 
				to word.length().
