			 	You are given a string array words and a binary array groups 
        both of length n, where words[i] is associated with groups[i].

        Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence 
        from words. A subsequence of words is alternating if for any 
        two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding 
        elements in the binary array groups differ. Essentially, 
        you are to choose strings such that adjacent elements have 
        non-matching corresponding bits in the groups array.

        Formally, you need to find the longest subsequence of an array 
        of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1] denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1], 
        such that groups[ij] != groups[ij+1] for each 0 <= j < k - 1 
        and then find the words corresponding to these indices.

        Return the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, 
        return any of them.

				1. Start With the First Word:
          . Add the first word to the result list since it starts the subsequence.
        2. Ensure Alternating Groups:
          . Iterate through the groups array starting from index 1.
          . If the current group value (groups[i]) differs from the previous group 
            value (groups[i - 1]), add the corresponding word (words[i]) to the 
            result list.
        3. Return the Result:
          . At the end of the loop, result contains the longest alternating
