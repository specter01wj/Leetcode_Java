			 	Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track 
				which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. 
				A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. 
				The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. 
				For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

				Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

				Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers 
				in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).


				Example 1:


				Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
				Output: [1,2]
				Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. 
				The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
				1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
				We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. 
				Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.

				Example 2:

				Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
				Output: [2]

				Example 3:

				Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
				Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
